In this Project we practice react component basic.

Task 1:
Output the "Key Concepts" data.

Task 2:
Identify Possible Components.

Task 3:
Create & Use (Re-usable) Custom Components.

By understanding the App.js file, we see that there is a repetition in order to view the data of the list.

We see that in the App.js there are two components that they can split up:
1) The Header.
2) The List.

So inside the src I going to make a new folder named components and in there
two more folders named Header, which is going to have the Header.js file, 
which is going to be the Header component, and the Concept folder 
which is going to have the Concept.js file, which is going to be the List component.

I copy and implement the Header.js and also the Concept.js.
For the Concept.js i used props in order to catch the data into my App.js file.
